# Overview
Coming soon, placeholder to reserve name on npmjs.org

# Goals
 - The rough idea is to create a library that makes it easy to display visuals (and maybe audio) across many
screens even coordinating the screens of a network of computers.
 - In addition I'd like to tie in the use of [lifesized](http://npmjs.org/lifesized) to be able to display large sized
objects across a group of screens.
 - Supporting using chromecast controlled screens would be very cool too.
   - See [castv2-client](http://npmjs.org/castv2-client) and [multicast-dns](http://npmjs.org/multicast-dns) for starting points on pure js implemented chromecast controls.
